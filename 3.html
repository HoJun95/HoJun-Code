I know that I, I can't believe
Just what the past has brought me
To the man I wanna be
I know that we have had some times
That we can't forget the struggle

I know we've changed but
Change can be so good
So let's not forget why
It's understood that
Time, look where we are and what we've been through</p>
Time, sharing our dreams
Time, goes on and on everyday, baby
Time is what it is
Come what may(come what may)
